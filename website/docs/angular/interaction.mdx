# Interacting with the Canvas

You can programmatically interact with the KritzelEditor to add, manipulate or delete objects on the canvas. 

## Accessing the KritzelEditor

To interact with the KritzelEditor, listen for its `isReady` event. The event's `detail` property provides a reference to the editor instance, which you can use to call its methods.

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  imports: [KritzelEditor],
  template: `
    <kritzel-editor (isReady)="onIsReady($event)"></kritzel-editor>
  `,
})
export class App {
  kritzelEditor!: HTMLKritzelEditorElement;

  async onIsReady(event: any): Promise<void> {
    this.kritzelEditor = event.detail;
    // You can now use this.kritzelEditor to interact with the canvas
  }
}

bootstrapApplication(App, appConfig);
```

## Adding objects

To add an object to the canvas, create an instance of a supported object type and use the editor's `addObject` method to insert it.
> The following objects are currently supported: `KritzelPath`, `KritzelText`, `KritzelImage`.

```typescript
// ...other code

const text = new KritzelText({
  value: 'Hello Kritzel!',
  translateX: 0,
  translateY: 0,
  fontSize: 24,
  fontFamily: 'Arial',
  fontColor: '#000000',
  height: 200,
  width: 200,
});

this.kritzelEditor.addObject(text);
```
In the example above a `KritzelText` object is created and added to the canvas.


## Updating objects

To update an object on the canvas, call the editor's `updateObject` method, passing the object you want to update and a partial object containing the properties to change.

 ```typescript
 this.kritzelEditor.updateObject(object, {
  translateX: 200,
  translateY: 200,
});
  ```


## Removing objects

To remove an object from the canvas, use the editor's `removeObject` method and pass the object you want to remove.

 ```typescript
  this.kritzelEditor.removeObject(object);
  ```

  ## Centering objects

To center an object in the viewport, use the editor's `centerObjectInViewport` method and pass the object you want to center.

```typescript
  this.kritzelEditor.centerObjectInViewport(object);
  ```



## Selecting objects

You can select objects on the canvas in two ways:

1. **Select specific objects:**  
  Pass an array of objects you want to select to the editor's `selectObjects` method.

  ```typescript
  this.kritzelEditor.selectObjects([object1, object2]);
  ```

2. **Select all objects in the viewport:**  
  Call the `selectAllObjectsInViewport` method to select all objects currently visible in the editor's viewport.

  ```typescript
  this.kritzelEditor.selectAllObjectsInViewport();
  ```

To retrieve the currently selected objects, use the editor's `getSelectedObjects` method. This method returns a promise that resolves to an array of all objects currently selected on the canvas.

 ```typescript
  this.kritzelEditor.getSelectedObjects().then((objects) => console.log(objects));
  ```
